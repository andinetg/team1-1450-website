    <h2 class="names"> MARY</h2>
       <img class="kjpic" src="Mary.jpg" alt="woman">

   
<p>
Mary has over 25 years of karaoke hosting experience. She originally started as a patron, but decided that shows were missing that something special – they needed to be more fun and entertaining. 

Mary believes that a karaoke show should be more than just a KJ calling the next singer, thus Margarita Mary's karaoke was born. Her favorite drink is Redbull Vodka, her favorite bands are Sugarland and Little Big Town & her favorite song to sing is "You and I" by Lady Ga Ga.

 <p> 
        Paul is well versed in crazy! He's been singing as long as he can remember. He is big on face to face communication and wonders if he is the last person on earth that thinks everyone should just "unplug". Paul has the worst love/hate relationship with MN - if it weren't for the hot summers and outdoor fun with his teenage son the winters wouldn't be worth it.  He's been hosting karaoke for over ten years and still loves almost every minute of it! He's a non-stop energy that just wants to have a fun time singing and dancing the night away.

        </div>
<p>Our killer red headed karaoke vixen. We discovered Rhianna about two years ago roaming the streets of coon rapids and just knew we had to have her be a part of our rad group of Kjs! Going to one of Rhianna's shows is quite the party! Her obvious love for being a dj makes it easy to pull the crowd out of their comfort zone! When she is not dj-ing she is busy slanging merchandise at Costco and playing carpool karaoke(just kidding but that would be hilarious) at her part time uber gig! Music and movies are a big part of Rhianna's  spare time and she could school you in some movie trivia! Along with that her spare time includes hanging out with family and friends and cheering on the Alabama crimson tide football team. Roll tide! Come out and let Rhianna give you a karaoke experience you won’t forget! Cheers!
